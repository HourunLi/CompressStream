# CompressStreamDB

This repo is part of the code of CompressStreamDB, containing the smart grids evaluation.

`CompressStream-client` is the client part, which can perform adaptive compression on the input data stream and transmit it to the server.

`CompressStream-server` is the server part, which can receive the compressed stream and execute queries directly.

Use the shell scripts in `/bin/` to run the system.
